# odin-adminpage
Learning project for making an admin page using css grid layout.
My aim is to complete the project in The Odin Project "Admin Dashboard" under "intermediate html and css". 
There is no functionality, but it is good practice in laying items out using css layouts I've learnt - grid and flexbox.

*Project Complete*
This project was fun! Satisfying to slowly build up the layout of the website - starting with the skeleton and gradually filling in sections to have nice styling. This website design was based off an image on The Odin Projet's page, but the html and css is all my own from scratch.
Things I've learnt this project:
    - Always best to build the complete skeleton first before going into detailed design
    - Consider **everything** from the design brief (i missed a couple headers which were difficult to add later on in)
    - Once the skeleton is done, set up a style guide with colours, fonts and sizes and put these in as variables at the start of the document - saves a lot of effort and makes for easier changes to colour schemes
    - Keep an organised css stylesheet! Its annoying to come back later and move stuff around, so keep it organised from the off!
