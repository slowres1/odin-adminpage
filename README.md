# odin-adminpage
Learning project for making an admin page using css grid layout.
My aim is to complete the project in The Odin Project "Admin Dashboard" under "intermediate html and css". 
There is no functionality, but it is good practice in laying items out using css layouts I've learnt - grid and flexbox.
